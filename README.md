# Agricultural Data Standard (ADS) – Public Draft

**Status:** Public Draft (v0.1)  
**Author / Steward:** Harikrishnan V S (Independent)

## Full Specification

The full ADS v1.0 specification is available in the `docs` folder:

[ADS v1 Public Draft](docs/ADS_v1_Public_Draft.md)

ADS is an open, interoperable data standard proposed to improve how agricultural IoT data is produced, exchanged, and reused in India.

This repository hosts the initial public draft of ADS. It is shared early and intentionally to invite feedback, critique, and experimentation.

## Why ADS exists

Agricultural data in India is already being generated at scale — by sensors, gateways, satellites, mobile apps, and government systems. However, most of this data remains siloed due to incompatible formats and vendor-specific pipelines.

ADS attempts to define a common, lightweight data contract that works under real field constraints.

## What ADS is (and is not)

**ADS is:**
- A proposed open standard
- Vendor-neutral and implementation-agnostic
- Designed for Indian agricultural conditions

**ADS is not:**
- A government mandate
- A commercial product
- A complete farm management solution
